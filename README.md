# Introduction to Digital Humanities: Assignment 2

This repository contains the LaTeX `.tex` file and associated Jupyter notebook for my social network analysis of the anime dataset from MyAnimeList. 

## Files:
- `IntroDH_Assignment2_LaTeX_EmmaLefever`: A zip file containing the main LaTeX document and images (figures) used in the report.
- `IntroDH_Assignment2_Notebook_EmmaLefever.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook used to generate the data for the report.
